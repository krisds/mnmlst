# A minimalist dataflow engine (dfntly)

This is a highly simplified and minimalist version of a Dataflow Engine. It is loosely inspired by the great [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/) library.

Built for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/). You'll also need [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html) to run.
