  // ## Edges in the Dataflow Graph
  //
  // There wouldn't be much dataflow if all nodes lived in isolation. Instead
  // we want to add links between nodes which depend on each other. 
  //
  // As an example, say that node F has a function to calculate its value, and
  // that this function depends on the value of another node X. Then there
  // should be a link between node F and node X.
  //
  // Now, we don't want the client to have to define all links between nodes.
  // That would be tedious and error-prone. Instead when a node gets
  // recalculated we'll track all nodes which are being read and add the links
  // automatically. To make that work we'll need to know which node is being
  // recalculated. This is the "active node":
  var active_node = null

  // Then we need to react to the recalculation, which means extending the
  // existing function somehow. Lacking real support for such an operation on
  // the language level we'll need to get creative...

  // So first we add an extra name which points to the existing function.
  Node.prototype.basic_recalculate = Node.prototype.recalculate

  // Then we redefine the old name. The new function adds the logic to set
  // the active node to this node, and to restore it afterwards. Of course we
  // also have to honour the existing contract of the function, which means
  // returning whether or not the node's value actually changed.

  // being used. It may be that upon recalculation some links just are not
  // needed anymore. We could remove these to prevent unnecessary recalcutions
  // later on...


  // ## The Engine
  //
  // So at this point we have a dataflow graph where the links between nodes
  // get established dynamically. But there is no automatic recalculation of
  // nodes yet when upstream nodes change. It's time to get that part going.

  // At runtime the engine needs to keep track of which nodes require
  // recalculation. For this we set up a simple queue of the pending nodes.
  var nodes_to_be_recalculated = []

  // We need to schedule nodes for recalulcation when one of their downstream
  // nodes changes. And change can come from recalculation, or from explicit
  // setting of the value from the outside.
  //
  // Let's start by adding a trigger upon recalculation. We'll use the same
  // trick we used earlier for extending the existing function.

  // We'll define the schedule_for_recalculation function soon. First let's
  // handle explicit setting of values. For that we'll define a setter
  // function, which is pretty much a counterpart to our earlier getter.

    if (new_value == this.value) return
    
    this.value = new_value
    schedule_for_recalculation(this.downstream_nodes)
  }

  // The scheduling function then. It adds all nodes to the queue, but tries to
  // avoid duplicates in the queue.
  // 
  // In addition, if the queue was empty then it also requests the engine to be
  // run when possible. We're targetting this engine to be run in a Node.js
  // environment and so will make use of the "setImmediate" function for that.
  function schedule_for_recalculation(nodes) {
    // The check for 'undefined' is required. We've set up the triggers for

  //
  // There are a lot of moving parts to this dataflow engine, but most of it
  // will be hidden from clients. In fact, we only expose three things to them:
  // the ability to create new nodes, the ability to read the value of a node
  // and the ability to update the value as well.
  //
  // For the reading and writing of a node's value we'll actually make a node
  // look as if it is a single function. If you pass it a value then it uses
  // that as the new value for the node. If you don't pass a value then it just
  // returns the current value.

    }).bind(this)
  }

  // Which leaves us with the means of creating nodes. Again we set up a
  // function for this. It takes a value or a function as a paramater and
  // passes that to the constructor of the Node. The node is then returned
  // in its functional form, as we just defined.
