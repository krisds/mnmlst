# Minimalist Parser Combinators (prsly)

This is a minimalist implementation of Parser Combinators, which you can use to define parsers for complex grammars.

Tested in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), but it should run in other Javascript engines as well. You'll need [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html) to run it.
