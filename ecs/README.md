# A minimalist entity/component system (ECS)

This is a highly simplified and minimalist version of an Entity/Component System. For more information and more complex examples the [Entity Systems Wiki](http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/) should give you a good starting point.

Tested in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/), but it should run in other Javascript engines as well. You'll need [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/docs/node.html) to run it.
